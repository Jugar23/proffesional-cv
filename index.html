									Within this role, I am tasked with working with children of varying ages from 8 years old to 18 years old. All of the children have complex needs within this environment such as autism, disabilities and sensory environment. I am tasked with supporting them through various things such as activities, going to the bathroom and helping with eating their food. difficult situations do arise such as a distressed child, child not listening and children hitting each other, through each of these scenarios i have gained excellent problem solving skills and it has made me very adaptable as i have had to learn some basic sign language to communicate with the children as a lot of them are non verbal so i have also gained an understanding of non-verbal cues.
